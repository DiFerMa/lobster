# LOBSTER

The **L**ightweight **O**pen **B**MW **S**oftware **T**raceability
**E**vidence **R**eport allows you to demonstrate software traceability
and requirements coverage, which is essential for meeting standards
such as ISO 26262.

This package contains a tool to interface with the proprietary
requirements management tool
[Codebeamer](https://intland.com/codebeamer).

## Tools

* `lobster-codebeamer`: Extract requirements from codebeamer.

## Configuration

*   This tool works with an optional config file. In it you can declare which 
    codebeamer fields should be used as 'refs' reference in the codebeamer file.

    For the 'refs' reference in config file you can write:

    ```
    {
    "refs" : "cb-fieldname"
    }
    ```
    or
    ```
    {
    "refs" : ["cb-fieldname"]
    }
    ```
    or
    ```
    {
    "refs" : ["cb-fieldname1", "cb-fieldname2"]
    }
    ```

* Schema (kind)

  You can also specify the type of schema for the resulting output file. The supported values for the kind field are:
  1. Activity: Sets the schema to lobster-act-trace.
  2. Implementation: Sets the schema to lobster-imp-trace.
  3. Requirement: Sets the schema to lobster-req-trace.

  If the kind is not specified, the tool will default to Requirement, and the schema lobster-req-trace will be used.

  Hereâ€™s an example configuration:
  `json code:` {"kind": "Activity",  // Specifies schema
                "refs": ["custom_ref_1", "custom_ref_2"]  // Specifies references
               }

  If an invalid kind is provided, the tool will raise an exception. Supported kind values are Activity, Implementation, and Requirement.

## Usage

There are two ways you can use this tool:

* Download all requirements mentioned by another lobster trace (this
  way you do not get a completeness check) (using `--import-tagged`)

* Download all requirements generated by a saved codebeamer query
  (using `--import-query`)

* Configure the 'refs' upstream reference (this argument is optional)
(using `--config`)

* Additionally, you can specify the schema and references:

  1. Specify the kind of trace to be generated (optional, defaults to Requirement)
     using the --schema argument, or configure it in the config file.
  2. Configure the 'refs' upstream reference (optional) using --config or
     specify directly via command line.

    * For example:
    ``` codepython lobster_codebeamer.py --config lobster-codebeamer-config.json --schema "Activity" --references "custom_ref_1```

       This command will extract activity traces (lobster-act-trace) with specified references.

## Limitations

The key limitation is item text, which is currently not
imported. However we do plan to also import item text eventually.
